# insent-ai
A custom JS app that can behave like the BOT using Insent APIs

This project follows microapp structure where there is a separate Node JS and Angular JS app created and deployed in microservices architecture.

These 2 separate projects are closely tied to each other as API's exposed by Node JS are custom made and aggregated for making front end Angular app's life 
easy and just to load and show the data being sent.

The Angular app inturn will start communicating via websockets to continue bot's conversation.

Code contributed entirely from scratch by P Prasanna.
